# fun-with-triangles

Triangle app built with Vanilla JS. There are 4 ways to interact:

1. An interface to compute triangle hypotenuse, given its sides
2. An interface to compute triangle area, given its sides
3. An interface to check if the three angles entered by the user form a triangle
4. A fun little quiz interface to check your triangle knowledge!
